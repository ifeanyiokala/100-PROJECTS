Dear Precious,

I wrote this poem for you,it's titled Precious

Life without your heart 
without your smile
without your love 
Life i live for 
Life i die for 
Life i would do anything for 
Anything for you 
Anything for you 
I miss you  
I can't wait to see you 
Because my life has no reason without you .


Love,Ifeanyi
